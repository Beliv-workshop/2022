<p><strong>Title: </strong> <br> 
We Should Never Stop BELIVing:
Reflections on 10 Years of Workshops on the
Esoteric Art of Evaluating Information Visualization</p>


<p><strong>Summary: </strong> <br> 

Wow! It has been 10 years since when Catherine, Giuseppe and I started
BELIV in 2006! Back then, I was just a fledgling PhD student, with
little understanding of what I was doing, but excited by the idea of
being able to contribute something new to our community. Not only was
visualization a niche topic back then, but its evaluation did not seem
to be a major worry in peopleâ€™s mind. Today, I have way more gray hair
and I am even more excited about doing something good for the community.
Visualization is now a thriving discipline, sought after and practiced
by many, and nobody would ever question the value and need for good and
thoughtful evaluation. In this talk, I will try to retrace the path of
BELIV: starting from its humble beginnings at AVI in Rome, up to its
current glorious status of established and respected academic event
people look forward to attend. I will use this opportunity to reflect on
how the role and practice of evaluation has changed during the last 10
years: how it was back then, what we have achieved so far, and how it
could be in 10 years from now. My talk will include recollections and
anecdotes from the past; statistics showing the progress we have made;
highlights on BELIV papers that have had a particularly significant
impact; and my personal reflections on what we may be able to achieve in
the future. Despite the many intricacies and struggles research and
evaluation put in front of us, I think our future can be bright. Very
bright. But it is up to us to make it happen. We all need to BELIV in it!

<p><strong>Speaker Bio: </strong> <br>

Enrico Bertini is Assistant Professor at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering
in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. His research focuses on
the study of effective data visualization methods and techniques to explore and make
sense of large and often high-dimensional data. He also studies how to communicate
complex ideas effectively through visual data presentation. His research has
been applied to several application domains including: biochemistry, cybersecurity,
development, healthcare, climate science, human rights.</p>


<p>
Professor Bertini earned his PhD degree in Computer Engineering at Sapienza University
of Rome in Italy. Before joining NYU, he was a Research Scientists at the
University of Fribourg, Switzerland, and the University of Konstanz, Germany. He
is part of the organizing and program committee of the IEEE VIS conference, the
premier conference in the field. In addition, he is one of the founders of the BELIV
workshop series on evaluation methods in visualization. He is also the editor of
fellinlovewithdata.com and datastori.es, respectively a popular blog and podcast on
visualization and data analysis.
